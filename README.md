# Flying_bird_game
JavaScript / jQuery game in which you help the bird fly through the obstacles.

This game is based on a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrzr-QBVNNM), but it's not exact copy of a tutorial game.

I made it to practice how games work with jQuery and if it's a better way than building game with canvas.

You can [play the game here](https://rawgit.com/JarekSopinski/Flying_bird_game/master/index.html).
